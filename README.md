# SFW Surfing - Kid Safe Browsing --> Extension

**Still deciding on whether we should block the dns address or just redirect the page to something else (like a youtube kids video)**

To Do:
- Create a NLP model that reads particular tags in a website(p>h3> etc - find out more)
- Create a DNS Blocking part that does two things:
      - Blocks the DNS address
      - Unblocks the DNS address
- Create a UI that does has the following things:
      - List of blocked DNS to Do/Undo the DNS blocking(also categorizes the website into their respective categories)
      - Enable/Disable active DNS blocking
      - Create a section to allow certain NSFW categories
  
**Progress**

- Created the nlp part which reads the paragraph(p) tags
-
**To-Do**
- Find more tags to gather words in the website (h3 etc)
- Turn everything into OOPs bullsh
- Create the UI Stuff
